    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Lab Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  "

From futuristic shapes and 70s accents to high-tech styles and “look-at-me” models, here are the five most creative eyewear styles for the upcoming season. Often paired with thin frames, tinted lenses add a fashionable touch to even the most conventional looks while reviving the spirit of the 70s and 80s. The Y2K era&#x27;s influence continues, restoring the cool factor that thin metal-framed glasses were missing. Meanwhile, at Bottega Veneta, Louise Trotter presented cat-eye glasses with gold details in a futuristic shape.

It doesn&#x27;t take a psychic to know what&#x27;s going to be trending next season. First seen across the spring/summer 2026 fashion month shows of Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and Saint Laurent, one trend that&#x27;s only going to get bigger this year is black oversize sunglasses. I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again: I love wearing sunglasses 365 days a year. While I know I look better in smaller frames (as pictured above), I&#x27;ve been liking the whole bug-eyed thing lately. There&#x27;s something especially fun about statement sunglasses since they can be the outfit on their own, which is how I feel when I&#x27;m wearing all basics and throw on my Giada pair from Chimi.

From futuristic shapes and 70s accents to high-tech styles and “look-at-me” models, here are the five most creative eyewear styles for the upcoming season. Often paired with thin frames, tinted lenses add a fashionable touch to even the most conventional looks while reviving the spirit of the 70s and 80s. The Y2K era&#x27;s influence continues, restoring the cool factor that thin metal-framed glasses were missing. Meanwhile, at Bottega Veneta, Louise Trotter presented cat-eye glasses with gold details in a futuristic shape. The spring/summer 2026 shows featured a plethora of eyewear, each more eye-catching than the last. *This article was translated to English using an AI tool.*.

    "## 6. Key Takeaways  \n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
